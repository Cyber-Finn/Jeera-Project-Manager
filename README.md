# Jeera - Project Manager
A Task Management solution for distributed teams and Project Managers.

## Requirements:
This system requires the following components:
<ol>
<li>A Web Server - I'm using AMPPS with Apache and PHP, but anything else should work as well as PHP is supported natively by most Web Servers.</li>
<li>A Database Management System (DBMS) - This has to be MySQL. Any version should work.</li>
<li>An internet connection -> Within our HTML, we're using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to load the libraries for JQuery, this requires an internet connection.</li>
</ol>
