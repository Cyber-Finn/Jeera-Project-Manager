# Jeera - Project Manager
An open-source and customizable Task Management solution for distributed teams and Project Managers.
<br>
This project mimics functionality of [Atlassian's Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), which is an Agile Project Management tool used to track projects and their status.

## Current Functionality:
I will be adding more functionality over time, but these are the currently supported features:
<ol>
  <li>Create Tasks</li>
  <li>Update Tasks</li>
  <li>View Tasks</li>
  <li>Complete Tasks</li>
  <li>Share the board with other users and monitor what they are working on</li>
  <li>All users have a Live view of each task and its status in the SDLC, allowing them to see updates in real-time</li>
</ol>

## Requirements:
This system requires the following components:
<ol>
<li>A Web Server - I'm using AMPPS with Apache and PHP, but anything else should work as well as PHP is supported natively by most Web Servers.</li>
<li>A Database Management System (DBMS) - This has to be MySQL. Any version should work.</li>
<li>An internet connection -> Within our HTML, we're using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to load the libraries for JQuery, this requires an internet connection.</li>
</ol>
