I tried to get the mobile solution working, but ran into lots of trouble, specifically around the way that clicks are handled on mobile.
I would've liked more time to resolve the mobile issues, but didn't focus too much on it since it was out of scope.

If I had enough time, I would've liked to make sure that the mobile version:
1. Headers display nicely
2. Can drag and drop tasks
But these functions seemed out of scope based on the business requirements.
